My name is David, and I like making coding projects and talking (writing?) about how I did it. Welcome to the journey!</p><h2>Blog posts</h2><ul><li>Eventually going to get something here :)</li></ul><p>But, you know what? <b>It's ok!</b> A journey of a thousand miles must begin with zero steps (or something like that)</p><h2>But Why?</h2><p>According to a lot of people who are smarter than me, it's a lot better to explain something to someone else than just trying to learn it for yourself. There's only one problem with that:</p><blockquote>I have to find someone to blabber to...</blockquote><p>Rather than going out and doing all the complicated work that goes into making someone care about what you have to say, I figured it's a lot easier to scream into the void of the internet and see what happens. And, I mean, if you're reading this, it must have worked somehow.</p></div></article>
